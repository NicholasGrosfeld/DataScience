This is a collection of tools for data science. Many of them have been 
developed through my work in climate and meteorology, but they are likely
to have applications in other fields also. 

These tools are freely available for anybody to use. Any feedback on how they
could be improved would also be appreciated- nick.grosfeld4@gmail.com
